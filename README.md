# A sampler module for AUTOMATONISM

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/megalon/pd-AUTOMATONISM-sampler/master/AUTOMATONISM-sampler-image.PNG)

This sampler module is a stereo sampler that will open any audio file that Pure Data supports (WAV and AIFF), at any sample rate. It allows variable pitch, length, and start position. The path to the file is stored within the statesave, so it should reload the sample when AUTOMATONISM starts up... Unless you move the sample file!
